#### Some Instructions
1. You may use any online resources, datasheets, or documentation needed, but be mindful of your time and stay focused on the task.
2. The duration of the test is 90 mins from 5:15pm to 6:45 pm.
3. There will be a MCQ test conducted [here](https://rudra26test.vercel.app/)
4. There are 4 tasks in the tests. Complete all of them.
5. In case you are not able to complete all the tasks, do upload whatever you are able to.
6. In the `README.md` of your repository include your thought process, places where you got stuck, where you used the help of AI, google or other online resources.
7. Even if you are not able to solve anything, do fill the readme and what your thought process would have been.
8. Carefully read the instructions to implement the required functionality.
9. Install [mingw(c compiler)](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/#w64devkit) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you haven't already done it.
10. After finishing your test, provide the link to your forked repository in the google form provided at the end.

### Aim/Objective: To decode GPS data of start and goal position, and create a path planning algorithm which computes an optimal path over a predefined gridmap

## Description
You are implementing code to decode GPS position data, received from a u-blox GNSS module on-board a rover (check out the [datasheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rOcPxpP-3JE8l39kBMiQV6KKe8B6zlDf/view)). You are given the current/start position of the rover and the goal position where the rover has to reach, your goal is to develop a path planning algorithm to traverse over a pre-defined gridmap and generate necessary odometry commands (total time & angle traversed) to guide the rover along the generated path. 

### Task 0: Fork the provided repository and ensure it is set to PUBLIC so we can access and assess your work.
### Task 1: Decoding gps data (in ubx format) from u-blox reciever.
Working with UBX format and extracted relevant navigation data for use in the planner.
### Task 2: Develop a path planning algorithm to traverse over a gridmap.
Implemented a grid-based path planner that computes an optimal route from start to goal.
### Task 3: Generate odometry commands to guide the rover along the generated path.
Converted the path into motion commands (direction and timing) based on wheel parameters.
### Task 4: Compile and run the code.
Verified the workflow on sample inputs and ensured the project compiles successfully with g++.

#### Code
1. [src/main.cpp](src/main.cpp): Code for running the test.
2. [src/ublox_reader.cpp](src/ublox_reader.cpp): Recitfy errors in this code to compute correct lat & lon coordinates.
3. [src/planning.cpp](src/planning.cpp): Complete the defined `Planner::pathplanning` function 
4. [src/odometry.cpp](src/odometry.cpp): Complete the defined `Odometry::computeCommands` function 

#### How to Compile & Check your code
(make sure you are in the root directory)   
1. Compile your code by running: `make build`
2. To check if your code is implemented correctly run: `make check`
   
If you are able to compile your code successfully you should see something like this on your screen:

```
*** Success: ***
--------------------------------------------
```

4. If your make check was unsuccesfull, you can clean your attempt by running `make clean`, review your implementation and repeat the previous steps.

Understanding of the codes:

1. main.cpp : This is the “controller” file.
It reads GPS data from a file, sets up a grid map, plans a path, runs odometry, and saves results

2.gridmap.cpp: This creates a grid map from GPS coordinates.
It converts lat/lon into grid cells.
It also marks some cells as obstacles (walls).

3. odometry.cpp: This calculates how the rover should move.
Based on wheel radius and RPM, it gives movement commands (time to move and turning angle).

4.ublox_reader.cpp :This reads GPS start and goal points from a file.
It extracts two lines → first line = start coordinates, second = goal coordinates.

5.planning.cpp: finds a safe path on the grid avoiding obstacles.

Problem Approaching:
Started with compiling all files together
g++ main.cpp gridmap.cpp planning.cpp odometry.cpp ublox_reader.cpp -o rover


Look at error messages one by one.
Fix easy errors first
Missing headers (<cmath>, <vector>, <queue>, <fstream>, etc.).
M_PI not found → replace with your own PI.
Wrong number of arguments → fix argc checks.

Check function returns
ublox_reader.cpp must return pair<GPS, GPS>.
planning.cpp must return vector<pair<int,int>>.
odometry.cpp must return OdoCommand.


Keep the logic simple
planning.cpp → BFS search.
odometry.cpp → distance/time from wheels.
gridmap.cpp → convert GPS to grid and mark obstacles.
